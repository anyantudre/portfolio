## About
Participated in the **1st edition of the Moroccan Mathematics Day (MDM)** at UM6P - Mohammed VI Polytechnic University.

As a passionate mathematics enthusiast, I had the privilege of participating alongside my teammate **Ihssane NEDJAOUI**. Together, we ran a stand presenting **Markov Chains** and some of their applications in Artificial Intelligence.


## Topics Presented

### Markov Chains Applications in AI
- **Weather Forecasting**: Probabilistic state transitions for prediction
- **Text Generation**: Language models based on state sequences
- **Image Generation**: Stochastic processes for creative AI


## Event Highlights
The day was filled with discoveries and featured conferences by eminent personalities from the world of Mathematics:
- **Raphael Liogier**
- **Virginie Bonnaillie-Noël**
- **Gregory Chaitin**
- **Guillaume Conchon--Kerjan** (with whom I had the chance to exchange)
- **El-Haj Laamri** (whose presentation on Henri Poincaré and his famous inequality particularly struck me)


## Networking
Beyond the fascinating conferences, this event was an opportunity to meet and exchange with brilliant minds sharing the same passion for Mathematics and its applications.
