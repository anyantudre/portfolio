I'm a final-year MEng student in **Data Engineering and Artificial Intelligence** at [ENSA Safi](https://www.umi.ac.ma/), with a strong foundation in applied mathematics and computer science. Currently, I work as a **Machine Learning Engineer** at [GO AI Corporation](https://goaicorporation.org/), where I design and deploy end-to-end data and AI systems for social good.

My research interests focus on **deep learning**, **computer vision**, **NLP**, and especially **speech and language technologies for low-resource languages**. I'm passionate about building AI solutions that can make a real impact, particularly for underserved communities.

## Current Focus

- **Low-Resource NLP & Speech**: Leading the development of translation and speech models for Mooré (7M+ speakers), now adopted by organizations like UNICEF and Tanager NGO for rural outreach in West Africa.
- **AI for Social Good**: Working on projects promoting access to education, local languages, and inclusive information access.
- **MLOps & Cloud**: Building production-ready ML pipelines on AWS and Azure.

## Recent Highlights

- **Mitacs Globalink Research Award** ($12,000 CAD) for research collaboration in Quantum ML at Université de Moncton, Canada.
- **2nd Place** at the pan-African Data Science Nations Cup (DataTour 2024) - Led a team among 100+ teams across Africa.
- **Microsoft Certified**: Azure Data Scientist Associate.
- **Oxford Machine Learning Summer School** (OxML 2025) - AI for Global Goals track.

## Technical Skills

**Programming:** Python, R, SQL, Java, C/C++  
**AI/ML:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Transformers, Hugging Face, LangChain, OpenCV  
**Data & Big Data:** MongoDB, Redis, Spark, Kafka, Airflow, Neo4j  
**Cloud & MLOps:** AWS, Azure, Docker, Git, MLflow, FastAPI, Django
