## Overview

Tagantino AI is a smart agriculture platform that helps Moroccan farmers better manage water resources by forecasting droughts using satellite data and providing real-time decision support through an LLM assistant.

## Key Components

### ETL Pipeline
- **Data Sources**: CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data)
- **Processing**: AWS Glue ETL for data transformation and cleaning
- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow for workflow management

### Deep Learning Models
- Drought forecasting models trained on historical satellite data
- Time-series prediction for precipitation and soil moisture levels

### LLM Assistant
- **RAG Architecture**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for contextual responses
- **LangChain Integration**: For building conversational AI workflows
- Real-time decision support for irrigation and crop planning

## Technologies

- **AI/ML**: Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Data Engineering**: AWS Glue ETL, Apache Airflow
- **LLM**: LangChain, RAG
- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript

## Impact

Helps farmers in water-scarce regions make data-driven decisions about irrigation, potentially reducing water waste and improving crop yields.
