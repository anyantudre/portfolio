## Overview

Led a team to **2nd place** at the **DataTour 2024 - pan-African Data Science Nations Cup**, a competition featuring 100+ teams from across Africa. The challenge focused on predicting energy demand to improve resource allocation across the continent.

## The Challenge

- **Objective**: Forecast energy demand across 50+ African countries
- **Data**: Socio-economic and environmental factors including GDP, population, climate data, and historical energy consumption
- **Evaluation**: Based on prediction accuracy and model interpretability

## Our Approach

### Data Analysis
- Extensive exploratory data analysis to understand patterns across different regions
- Feature engineering based on domain knowledge of energy consumption drivers

### Modeling
- Ensemble of regression models (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Cross-validation strategies accounting for geographical and temporal dependencies
- Feature importance analysis for interpretability

### Results
- **Ranked Top 3** on the final leaderboard
- Strong performance on both accuracy and robustness metrics

## Technologies

- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **ML**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM

## Impact

Accurate energy demand forecasting helps African nations better plan infrastructure investments and resource allocation, contributing to sustainable development goals.
