## Overview

WrinnnAI is a real-time streaming mobile assistant designed for the visually impaired. It uses **Computer Vision and Speech processing** to provide environmental awareness and navigation assistance.

## Key Features

- **Environmental Description**: Real-time scene understanding and narration using Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
- **Obstacle Alerts**: Automatic detection and warning for obstacles in the user's path
- **GPS Navigation**: Voice-guided navigation with turn-by-turn directions
- **Voice Commands**: Hands-free interaction through natural language commands
- **Low Latency Streaming**: Optimized for real-time performance on mobile devices

## Technologies

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Computer Vision (OpenCV), Vision-Language Models
- **Mobile App**: Flutter for cross-platform deployment
- **Speech**: Text-to-Speech (TTS) for audio feedback
- **AI Models**: Transformers for image understanding and command parsing

## Impact

This project aims to improve independence and safety for visually impaired individuals by providing real-time awareness of their surroundings through accessible audio feedback.
