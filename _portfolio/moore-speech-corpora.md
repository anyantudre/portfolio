## Overview

Built an open-source toolkit to collect, preprocess, align, and normalize low-resource Mooré language speech/text data. Mooré is spoken by 7M+ people across 5+ West African countries.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection**: Automated scraping of parallel text-audio data from various sources
- **Preprocessing**: Audio resampling, normalization, and cleaning pipelines
- **Forced Alignment**: Integration with MMS Forced Aligner for precise text-audio alignment
- **HuggingFace Integration**: Direct export to HuggingFace Datasets format

## Impact

This toolkit helps the research community address data scarcity challenges for low-resource languages and enables downstream NLP applications like:
- Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
- Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Machine Translation
